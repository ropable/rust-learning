Adventures in learning the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming
language.

**Note**: having installed [rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs),
remember to run ``source ~/.cargo/bin`` in a shell session to add the rust
binaries to the path.

Cargo commands:

```
cargo new project_name --bin
cargo build
cargo build --release
cargo run
```
